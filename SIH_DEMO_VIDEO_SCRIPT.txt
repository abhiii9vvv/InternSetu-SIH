Problem Statement ID: 25034
Title: AI-Based Internship Recommendation Engine for PM Internship Scheme
Organization: Ministry of Corporate Affairs
Category: Software | Theme: Smart Education
Video Duration: 8-10 minutes

================================================================================
                              PROBLEM STATEMENT DETAILS
================================================================================

BACKGROUND:
The PM Internship Scheme receives applications from youth across India, including 
rural areas, tribal districts, urban slums, and remote colleges. Many of these 
candidates are first-generation learners with limited digital exposure and no 
prior internship experience. With hundreds of internships listed on the portal, 
it becomes difficult for such candidates to identify which ones match their 
skills, interests, or aspirations.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Misaligned applications and missed opportunities
- Information overload for first-generation learners
- Limited digital literacy among rural candidates
- Need for mobile-compatible, simple interface
- Multi-language support requirement
- Integration with existing government portals

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
A functional prototype that:
• Captures basic candidate inputs (education, skills, sector interests, location)
• Uses a rule-based or ML-light model to suggest 3-5 top internships
• Has a simple, intuitive UI with minimal text and visual cues
• Can be accessed on mobile devices and adapted to regional language use
• Outputs recommendations in a clear, user-friendly format
